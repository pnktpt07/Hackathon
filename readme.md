# Selenium Automation Hackathon Project: EMICalculator.net
 
## Project Overview
 
This Selenium automation testing project focuses on automating tasks related to the "EMICalculator.net". The primary objectives include , giving the value to the text box and use of scale to get the car loan price , navigating through the different loan menu, verifying the presence of text box & scales, and  Re-use the same validation for Loan Amount Calculator & Loan Tenure Calculator . The project uses various dependencies and libraries to facilitate automation.

## Automation Test Flow
 
1. **Open EMICalculator.net page**
 - Navigate to the Car Loan.
 
2. **Click on Car Loan**
 - Give the value to the textbox for loan amount , Interest rate and tenure.
 - Scroll down and take the value of principal amount and itrest amount.
 - Print the value and take screenshots.
 
3. **Verify and Navigate to Home Loan EMI calculator**
 - Fill the Home Loan details.
 - Get all the data from  year on year table.
 - Print the data and store the data in excel sheet.
 
4. **Verify and Navigate to Loan calculator**
 - Verify the title "Loan Calculator â€” Calculate EMI, Affordability, Tenure & Interest Rate".
 
5. **Click on EMi Calculator**
 - Validate all the text box given .
 - Validate the all the scales before and after giving the value .
 - Take Screeshot of the page.
 - Re-use the same validation for Loan Amount Calculator & Loan Tenure Calculator
